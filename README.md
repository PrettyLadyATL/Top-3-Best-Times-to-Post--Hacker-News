# Top-3-Best-Times-to-Post--Hacker-News
In this project, we'll discover the top three best times to post content for optimal engagement. Our data set is from Hacker News, comprised of submissions information.  The working data set was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments. Most of our courses are on data analytics/data science, and I have expanded learning to include cloud interaction and Power BI.  The goal is to analyze existing data about already high engagement articles to find the best placement for optimal engagement. To make our recommendation, we'll try to find out: We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:  Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? Do posts created at a specific time receive more comments on average? I collected and sorted the data from top to engagement topics Ask HN and Show HN to:  Determine which engagement topic receives more comments on average. Determine which post created at a particular time receive more comments on average. Propose a strategy for increased exposure based on analyzed data.
